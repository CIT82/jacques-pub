# A Day in My Life
Here's a breakdown of my day to day life.

## Work
I work Monday through Friday from *early* morning and early afternoon.
At first, it was a **struggggle** to get up as early as I do<br>

However, I'm okay now.

## Afternoon and Evenings
If I'm not working on code or binge watching shows and true crime, I'm usually playing [The Sims 4](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4) or working on homemade crafts.

When it's time to go to bed, I'll throw something on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) to play in the background (with autoplay off) as I drift off to sleep.

### Overall
My day is overall simple. I tend to get anxiety easily, so being a homebody these days are my comfort.
