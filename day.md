# A Day in My Life
Here's a breakdown of my day to day life.
1. Go to work from 7 AM to 3:30 PM
2. Side work: coding, curriculum creation
3. Playing games, working on crafts, and watching shows and True Crime
4. Go to bed

## Work
I work Monday through Friday from *early* morning and early afternoon.
At first, it was a **struggggle** to get up as early as I do<br>

However, I'm okay now.

## Afternoon and Evenings
If I'm not working on school assignments, code, or side work/projects, I'm usually doing the following:
- playing [The Sims 4](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4)
- sewing or crocheting handmade crafts
- binge watching one of my favorite shows on rotation (I rarely watch new shows because I'm picky ðŸ˜­)

When it's time to go to bed, I'll throw something on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) to play in the background (with autoplay off) as I drift off to sleep.

### Overall
My day is overall simple. I tend to get anxiety easily, so being a homebody these days are my comfort.
